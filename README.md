This is a mockup of a online smartwatch store. I created this to test my capabilities of UI/UX.

To-do:
1. Product pages
2. Revamped Header bar
3. Mobile Header
4. Login Page
5. Contact Page
6. Cart page with keeping track of carted products

This is just a hobby project, so i dont expect for all of this to be actually completed.
The project has been made with ReactJSX and TailwindCSS.
This is my first TailwindCSS project with no tutorial or help.
